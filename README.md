# Gen
A minecraft communication application, chat in servers all from your terminal.
```
-server <name.com> switches the server you wish to join.
-load <savename>
-new account (logs into a new acc and saves it to the config)
-remove account <save name of account> removes the json from the config.
-close | This closes the connection to the current server your logged into.
-help (displays all commands)
```

# What can this do?

Very basic things, atm you can chat in servers and switch between accounts (a bit buggy atm).
This could also be very useful for AFK in servers or just basic chat discussions!
