A minecraft communication application, chat in servers all from your terminal.
```
-server <name.com> switches the server you wish to join.
-load <savename>
-new account (logs into a new acc and saves it to the config)
-close | This closes the connection to the current server your logged into.
-help (displays all commands)
```
This is a wip.
